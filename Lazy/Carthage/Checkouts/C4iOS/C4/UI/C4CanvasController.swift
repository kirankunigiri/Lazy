/// The C4CanvasController class provides the infrastructure for managing the views of your iOS apps. A canvas controller manages a set of views that make up a portion of your app’s user interface. It is responsible for loading and disposing of those views, for managing interactions with those views, and for coordinating responses with any appropriate data objects. Canvas controllers also coordinate their efforts with other controller objects—including other view controllers—and help manage your app’s overall interface.
